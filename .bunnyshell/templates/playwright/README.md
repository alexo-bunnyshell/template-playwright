# Template overview

This Environment [Template](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/templates-what-are-templates) demonstrates how to use Playwright to test an application in a Bunnyshell environment. 

The template provides the Bunnyshell configuration for a Playwright-based test environment.

An [Environment in Bunnyshell](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/environments) is a user-defined group that brings together applications and all of the services and databases those applications require.

## Template specifics

Playwright is deployed as a component inside the environment, next to the application to be tested.
Sample tests are provided in the `tests/test-external-service` folder. Replace these with your own tests.
The application dested in this environment is built from 'https://github.com/bunnyshell/template-vue-tailwind.git', but you can replace it with your own application/repo.
